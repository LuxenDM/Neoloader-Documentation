Creating plugins compatible with Neoloader means following certain
design principles, but the effort will provide benefits to your
plugin's users.<br>
First off, while normal plugins only require a single 'main.lua' file
containing the plugin's code, in the usage of Neoloader a plugin will
require three:<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 40%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>Main.lua</li>
        <li>&lt;name&gt;.ini</li>
        <li>&lt;name&gt;.lua</li>
      </ul>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;"><img src="files.png" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
In this case, main.lua is used exclusively to verify the registration
process of your plugin; You can include other code in it, but this code
will continue to be loaded by the old plugin loader and won't be
managable by Neoloader.<br>
<br>
The INI file here is the plugin's "registration" details, and <a href="ini.html">the formatting can be viewed on this page</a>. This
contains the data Neoloader needs for determining your plugin's load
position, plus other optional information.<br>
<br>
The third file is what would contain your actual mod's code. Once
registered and activated, this is the file that is executed. The INI
file should point to this, with a relative or absolute file path.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Converting plugins *can* be
pretty simple, if you only want to manage your existing mods using
Neoloader.<br>
<ul>
  <li>If your mod accesses other files, you will need to change how
files are accessed. Neoloader loads BEFORE the standard mod loader, so
dofile/loadfile do not automatically contain preset paths. Neoloader
provides lib.resolve_file() to improve potential file access, allowing
multiple attempts at locating a file.</li>
</ul>
In order to convert your old plugins to be managed through Neoloader,
just follow these steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Rename your main.lua file</li>
  <ul>
    <li>WHAT you rename it to doesn't matter, other than that you will
be providing this name in the mod's registration file</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Create and complete a mod registration file describing your
plugin (see <a href="ini.html">INI registration</a> for more
information)</li>
  <li>Create a new main.lua file that registers your mod with Neoloader</li>
</ol>
