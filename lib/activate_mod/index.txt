lib.activate_mod

Definition:
	lib.activate_mod (id, version, verification_key) -> nil
Description:
	attempts to activate a mod in the registry
Arguments:
	string id: name of the mod to be activated
	string version: version of the mod to be activated
	verification_key: a security key given to Neoloader's active management system

notes:
	Mods shouldn't try to self-load, as we want the user to manually enable mods. Hence why this function requires a key to be used.
